To perform the feature extraction:
- run productsapp/import.py to import from CSV files
- change the path to the path of the amazon reviews .csv file
- run feature_extraction/extract.py (this will take a long time most likely)
- import the University Of Leipzig wikipedia frequency count (eng_wikipedia_2016_1M folder)
- in feature_extraction/scaffidi/scaffidi.py change the database settings to your database with the wikipedia frequency count
- run feature_extraction/scaffidi/scaffidi.py to perform product feature score calculation

To extend the WordNet graph:
- update text_entailment/settings.py paths to the original graph and the location of the updated path
- run rdf/extend_wn_graph.py

To use the system:
- install and start Indra: https://github.com/Lambda-3/IndraComposed
- follow django deploy tutorial or use pycharm: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/deployment/
- import the database dump to get existing data: LINK: TODO then change the settings.py file to make it use that database
